# SynSave

A project aimed at resurrecting saveinstance function from Synapse X.<br />
Reason: Many Executors fail miserably at providing good user experience when it comes to tinkering with saving instances.

> [!TIP]
> Important part about this saveinstance is that it doesn't modify anything, therefore reduces the amount of detection vectors by a lot.<br />
> You can also enable the `SafeMode` option to completely bypass any detections and save **ANY** game!<br /><br />
> If this script is helpful to you, please click `⭐ Star` in the upper right corner of the page to support it, thank you!

> - [Moon/LorekeeperZinnia][@LorekeeperZinnia] for being the original creator of saveinstance that was used in Synapse X, Elysian and many others. As well as being an inspiration for this project.
> - [Rojo Rbx Dom Xml] for being a fallback documentation in case something wasn't clear in the [Roblox Format Specifications]
> - [Roblox File Format] for a list of redirects of old/deprecated xml properties that still use the old tag values
> - [Roblox Client Tracker] for an extended & close to full JSON Api Dump (with hidden properties & default values)
